# ASTEROIDS

Welcome to my remake of the arcade classic Asteroids!

In this game, you control a spaceship stranded in an asteroid field. Dodge the asteroids coming your way, or shoot at them to destroy them and score points!

Colliding with an asteroid results in a game over. Try to earn as many points as possible before you get hit!

### Controls
* Use the WASD keys to move
  * Move forwards and backwards with W and S
  * Rotate left and right with A and D


* Use the spacebar to shoot
* You can't move beyond the edge of the game area
